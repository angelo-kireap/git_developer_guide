## How to Commit and Push Changes

Follow these steps for basic commit and push operations in Git:

### 1. **Stage Your Changes**  
   Use `git add` to stage files for commit:  
   ```bash
   git add <file_name>  # Add a specific file
   git add .            # Add all changed files in the current directory
   ```

### 2. **Commit Your Changes**  
   Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add a descriptive message here"
   ```

   **Commit Message Guidelines**:  
   - Use the present tense (e.g., "Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").  
   - Be concise but informative.

   Example:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix email validation regex and add test cases"
   ```

### 3. **Push Your Changes**  
   Push your changes to the remote branch:  
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```

   Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of your branch.

### 4. **Create a Pull Request**  
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub.  
   - Click **"Compare & pull request"**.  
   - Fill out the PR form using the format described above.
